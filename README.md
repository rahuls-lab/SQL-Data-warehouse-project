# 🗃️ SQL Data Warehouse Project

Welcome to my  comprehensive  **Data Warehouse and Analytics** Projects Repository! 👋

This project demonstrates end-to-end data warehousing capabilities, transforming raw data into actionable business insights. As a Data Analyst, I've implemented industry best practices across three core dimensions:

-   **🔗 Data Pipeline Engineering**: Designing efficient ETL workflows to extract, transform, and load data seamlessly.
-   **📝 Data Modeling**: Structuring dimensional models for optimal query performance and analytical clarity.
-   **📈 Business Intelligence**: Developing interactive dashboards and visualizations to drive data-driven decisions.

**Tech Stack**: PostgreSQL | Tableau

# Data Architecture
The data architecture for this project follows **Medallion Architecture** Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

**Medallion Architecture Layers**
- 🥉 **Bronze Layer** (Raw Ingestion) :
Preserves source data in its original state, ingesting raw datasets from CSV files directly into PostgreSQL database tables with complete fidelity and auditability.
- 🥈 **Silver Layer** (Transformation & Quality) :
Executes comprehensive data cleansing, standardization, and normalization processes transforming raw data into validated, consistent datasets primed for analytical consumption.
- 🥇 **Gold Layer** (Analytics-Ready) :
Delivers production-grade, business-ready data structured in optimized **star schema models**, purpose-built for high-performance reporting and advanced analytics.

# Project Overview

This end-to-end data warehouse solution encompasses four critical dimensions of modern analytics:

- **Data Architecture**: Architected a scalable data warehouse leveraging Medallion Architecture—systematically refining data through Bronze (raw), Silver (cleansed), and Gold (analytics-ready) layers
- **ETL Pipeline Development**: Engineered automated extraction, transformation, and loading processes to seamlessly migrate data from source systems into the warehouse
- **Dimensional Modeling**: Designed star schema structures with optimized fact and dimension tables for high-performance analytical queries
- **Analytics & Reporting**: Developed SQL-driven analytical reports and interactive Tableau dashboards that translate data into actionable business insights

🎯 Learning Showcase
As a **Data Analyst**, this repository demonstrates hands-on proficiency across the complete analytics stack:

- SQL Development - Complex query optimization and database programming
- Data Architecture - Modern warehouse design patterns and best practices
- ETL Engineering - Building robust data pipelines and transformation logic

##  Project Requirements

### Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

### Objective 
Built a robust data warehouse with **PostgreSQL** to consolidate and structure sales data for advanced analytics. This solution provides the foundation for comprehensive reporting and data-informed business strategies. 💡

### Specifications
| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Data Sources** | Ingests and processes data from two key source systems (ERP and CRM) provided via CSV files. |
| **Data Quality** | Performs essential data cleansing and validation to ensure the integrity and reliability of the data before analysis. |
| **Data Integration** | Consolidates the cleaned data into a single, unified model that is optimized for efficient analytical queries. |
| **Project Scope** | The analysis is focused exclusively on the most recent dataset; historical data tracking is not included. |
| **Documentation** | Provides clear, comprehensive documentation of the data model to support both technical and business stakeholders. |

### BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analytics)

### 🎯 Objective

The primary goal is to harness SQL-driven analytics to extract strategic insights across three critical business dimensions:

-   👥 **Customer Behaviour**: Analyze purchasing behaviors, transaction patterns, and customer segmentation to understand engagement dynamics and lifetime value.
-   🚀 **Product Performance Analysis:**: Identify top-performing SKUs, revenue drivers, and untapped growth opportunities through product-level metrics.
-   📈 **Sales Trends**: Detect temporal patterns, seasonality effects, and market trends to inform strategic planning and revenue optimization.

  These analytics deliver actionable KPIs and performance metrics, empowering business stakeholders to make evidence-based strategic decisions with confidence.
